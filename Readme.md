Welcome to your MS-DOS dreams
================================

AvixSoft 486 is a company that focuses on making retro-style games and modern game. But along with games, we built a fully bootable GUI for any compter that can boot from a floppy disk! Its name is Avix 486 and it's built to last. You can read more about it in their Section specifically made for them.

## Avix 486

This is an Operating System that is fully ready. It can run old MS-DOS programs but has a advanced user interface (GUI). This is the 32 bit version that has faster and better proccessing while having its own programming language and many thing that windows today would have, even an internet browser. You can put these files on a floppy disk or a bland HardDrive to boot it up, even on modern computers as well! If you want to run it without booting it, you can use DosBox to do so. Just drag the BOOT.BAT file onto the DosBox Shortcut to boot it.
