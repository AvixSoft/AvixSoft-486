Welcome to your Retro Computer dreams
================================

AvixSoft 486 is a company that focuses on making retro-style games and modern games aswell. But along with games, we built a fully bootable GUI for any compter that can boot from a floppy disk! Its name is Avix 486 and it's built to last. You can read more about it in their Section specifically made for them.

## Avix 486

This is an Operating System that is fully ready. It can run old MS-DOS programs but has a Advanced Executable Graphical User Interface (AXGUI). This is the 32 bit version that has faster and better proccessing while having its own programming language and many thing that windows today would have, even an internet browser. You can put these files on a floppy disk or a blank HardDrive to boot it up, even on modern computers as well! If you want to run it without booting it, you can use DosBox to do so. Just drag the BOOT.BAT file onto the DosBox Shortcut to boot it.

## Avix Workdesk

Avix Workdesk is an enhanced version of Avix 486. Unlike its predecessor, Avix Workdesk was built for gaming and 3D programs (including games like Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, and Quake! In the welcome window, you can access a 3D Engine built by Darren Morris called the Xeno Engine. A game you can play is Miner17, a game where you have to collect all the gold possible. Being an advanced GUI, an AXGUI, you can 
now change the theme of the styles of your windows (W.I.P.). The styles are Classic, Laser, TechnoFeel, and Shell. Now the download includes a software to make a bootable USB called Rufus 2.15. All you do is format a USB with FreeDOS, extract the file AWORK14.ZIP, copy the files onto that USB, restart your computer, and boot from the USB. If you want to run it without booting it, you can use DosBox to do so. Just drag the START.BAT file onto the DosBox Shortcut to boot it.
